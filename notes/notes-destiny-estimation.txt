Introduction:

	Posterior probability, in Bayesian statistics: P(G|T) = P(T|G)*P(G)/P(T)
	
	The information about the same feature of the same object are provided by multiple sources. The best will not throw away any information, because fidelity is limited by various reasons.
	-> In Bayesians terms, the posterious probability over the stimulus given the activities of the neurons will match the corresponding posterious given the input signals.
	Encoding in the integrating neurons the entiry posterior is crusial, because this distribution contains the informations about the confidence of the estimate.
	The human subjects appear to choose the actions based of the peak of the optimal posterior over the stimulus, given by a variety of multisensory inputs.
	
	
	The integration is learned.
	The plausible neural model, then, must learn without supervision how to combine optimally signals from two or more input population.
