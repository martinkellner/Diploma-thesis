## Annotation
Sensory processing in the brain entails multisensory integration (combining cues into a single common underlying stimulus) and coordinate transformations (the change of reference frame for a stimulus, e.g. retinotopic to body-centered, effected through knowledge about an intervening variable, e.g. gaze position). This ability is crucial in cognitive robotics in order to endow robots with an ability to operate autonomously in the 3D space.

## Aim
1. Study the cognitive neuroscience literature related to sensory integration and the frames of reference (coordinate systems).
2. Implement and train an artificial neural network model on simulated data integrating visual and proprioceptive information, performing a coordinate transformation in hand-eye related task, using the iCub robotic simulator.
3. Evaluate and analyze the behavior of the trained model.
